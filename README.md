I AM A FIRST SEM STUDENT DOING MY FIRST HACKATHON IN WHICH I GOT A CHALLENGE OF CREATING EXOPLANET EXPLORATION INTERESTING AND ACCESSIBLE FOR BEGINNERS . MY INNOVATIVE IDEA IS TO BUILD A REAL LIFE SIMULATION GAME 
IN WHICH THE PLAYER WILL BE FREE TO MOVE AND HAVE SOME SPECIAL POWER TO WONDER FROM ONE GALAXY TO ANOTHER BY JUST ONE CLICK IN THIS GAME USER CAN GET ALL THE INFORMATION NECESSARY FOR BEGINNERS TO KNOW ABOUT THAT 
PLANET SO BY THIS SIMULATION HE/SHE WILL GET A PROPER EXPERIENCE AND ADD SOME VALUEABLE KNOWLEDGE TO HIM/HER.
