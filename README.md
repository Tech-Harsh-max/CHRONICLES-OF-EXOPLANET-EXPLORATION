I AM A FIRST SEM STUDENT DOING MY FIRST HACKATHON IN WHICH I GOT A CHALLENGE OF CREATING EXOPLANET EXPLORATION INTERESTING AND ACCESSIBLE FOR BEGINNERS . 
• MY INNOVATIVE IDEA IS TO BUILD A REAL LIFE SIMULATION GAME IN WHICH THE PLAYER WILL BE FREE TO MOVE AND HAVE SOME SPECIAL POWER TO WONDER FROM ONE GALAXY TO ANOTHER BY JUST ONE CLICK IN THIS GAME USER CAN GET ALL THE INFORMATION NECESSARY FOR BEGINNERS TO KNOW ABOUT THAT particular PLANET 
•SO BY THIS SIMULATION HE/SHE WILL GET A PROPER EXPERIENCE AND ADD SOME VALUEABLE KNOWLEDGE TO HIM/HER.
•The 3 files uploaded above are the codes of our sample and rough prototype
 and 
•Additional to that i created a simple webpage of exoplanet explorationt that redirect the user to the google search results of that particular planet he/she clicked
